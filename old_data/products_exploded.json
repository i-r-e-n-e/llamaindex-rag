    "description": "Vibrant red resin combines with recently rediscovered thuja sutchuenensis wood\nSirius Dice is pleased to introduce The Grove Series.  Hand crafted precious hardwood is set into tinted resin to create a dice set unlike any other.  \nEach set is a work of art with unique wood grain and placement for each die.  Also each die has its own inking for numbers and shading for both wood and resin.  Finally, each die is hand polished multiple times to display the luster of the precious wood.  No two dice will ever match, creating a true one-of-a-kind product.\nEvery set of Grove dice comes with a premium dice vault of sustainably sourced hardwood from Mexico and supple imitation leather band.  \n\nThe Crimson Grove dice set was crafted from a precious hardwood thought lost to the world for a century.  In 1899, French botanist Paul Guillaume Farges cataloged a rare evergreen tree known as Sichuan thuja.  \nSightings of this rare species quickly grew fewer and it was thought to have gone extinct.   After a century of searching, was rediscovered on mountain slopes not far from Farges initial finds.\nNative to central China, this decay resistant, sweetly fragrant wood is now carefully forested for sustainability.  The Crimson Grove set is hand crafted from this precious evergreen to create dice that are works of art.\nEach Crimson Grove dice set is held in a vault of cherry wood.  This sustainably sourced wood is renowned for aging beautifully from a light pink coloration to a rich reddish hue with a lustrous patina.\n\nOnly 675 Crimson Grove sets were produced, and each one of these Limited Edition sets includes a certificate of authenticity.  Reserve your copy today before they are gone forever.",
